We face a problem in our dataset of having very few data points being for confirmed fraud and a lot of data points for other which we cannot classify as being non fraudulent. Hence, we have the idea of using anomaly detection via neural networks to hopefully train a model that can learn what fraud looks like and learn the class of fraudulent loans (or similiarly the class of non fraud loans) and detect anomalies to detect things that do not belong to the desired class. So we have started to explore the areas of one class neural networks for anomaly dtection as a result. We looked at two papers in this area: Anomaly Detection using One-Class Neural Networks by Chalapathy, et al and Deep One-Class Classification by Ruff, et al. Both of these papers provide useful insights into how neural networks can be optimized for anomaly detection. OC-NN’s ability to refine feature extraction for anomaly detection and Deep SVDD’s structured approach provide a useful theoretic background to our project which we hope to explore further. By leveraging these ideas we aim to develop a neural network that can generalize well even with the limited availability of confirmed fraud cases and solve a major problem present in our dataset.
